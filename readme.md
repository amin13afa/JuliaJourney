I am learning Julia programming language. Through this journey I would save everything that I learn, test and explore; save and share here.
Some of the  stored content here will be from Youtube channels, and especially the [Julia language youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJuliaLanguage/featured) or online tutorials. Every resource will be shared by its link in the description of project.
